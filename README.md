# boost_py_cpp_binding
Simple example to automatically create the python interface for a C++ class
(Referred to https://flanusse.net/interfacing-c++-with-python.html)

`Makefile_1` is a slight improvement over `Makefile` and uses Py++ for automated interface generation.
`tmp.py` has minimal code to check if interfacing worked.
